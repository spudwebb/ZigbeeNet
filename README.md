# ZigBeeNet [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/o2x3lg7eo46jl2j5/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Mr-Markus/zigbeenet-mlw5f/branch/master) [![NuGet Status](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/ZigBeeNet.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ZigBeeNet) [![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/Zigbee_Net.svg?style=social)](https://twitter.com/Zigbee_Net)

ZigBeeNet is a implementation of the Zigbee 3.0 Cluster Library for .NET Standard.

It is fully implemented in Netstandard 2.0 and NET Core 3.0 so that it runs on multiple platform

## Smart Home

With Zigbee 3.0 you can also build your own Smart Home solution and control Zigbee devices from different manufactures like Philips with Philips Hue and IKEA with Tradfri at the same time in the same network. So you are very flexible and the components are very cheap.

## Usage

For a detailed description about how to use ZigBeeNet see our [wiki page](https://github.com/Mr-Markus/ZigbeeNet/wiki):

- [Getting Started](https://github.com/Mr-Markus/ZigbeeNet/wiki/Getting-started)
- [Get node and endpoint address](https://github.com/Mr-Markus/ZigbeeNet/wiki/Get-node-and-endpoint-address)
- [Read attributes](https://github.com/Mr-Markus/ZigbeeNet/wiki/Read-attributes)
- [How to control devices](https://github.com/Mr-Markus/ZigbeeNet/wiki/How-to-control-devices)

You can also take a look at the [Playground Demo project](https://github.com/Mr-Markus/ZigbeeNet/blob/develop/samples/ZigBeeNet.PlayGround/Program.cs)

If you need further information we will help you whenever you need it. Just open an new issue for it.

A basic example here:

```cs
using System;

namespace ZigBeeNet.PlayGround
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            try
            {
                ZigBeeSerialPort zigbeePort = new ZigBeeSerialPort("COM4");

                IZigBeeTransportTransmit dongle = new ZigBeeDongleTiCc2531(zigbeePort);

                ZigBeeNetworkManager networkManager = new ZigBeeNetworkManager(dongle);

                // Initialise the network
                networkManager.Initialize();

                networkManager.AddSupportedCluster(0x06);

                ZigBeeStatus startupSucceded = networkManager.Startup(false);

                if (startupSucceded == ZigBeeStatus.SUCCESS)
                {
                    Log.Logger.Information("ZigBee console starting up ... [OK]");
                }
                else
                {
                    Log.Logger.Information("ZigBee console starting up ... [FAIL]");
                    return;
                }
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(ex.ToString());
            }

            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
```

## Zigbee Stacks

Because Zigbee is just a specification you need a stack of a manufacturer that implements it. ZigBeeNet is developed with a strict seperation of the Zigbee Cluster Library (ZCL) and the various manufacturer stacks. Because of that it is possible to use different hardware for your Zigbee solution

If there is a manufacturer solution missing, feel free to open an issue or take part of it's implementation

### Texas Instruments ( Z-Stack )

Z-Stack 3.0.x is TI's Zigbee 3.0 compliant protocol suite for the CC2530, CC2531, and CC2538 Wireless MCU.
Z-Stack comunicates through TI's Unified Network Processor Interface (NPI) which is used for establishing a serial data link between a TI SoC and external MCUs or PCs. UNPI is also implemented in this project and is also implemented for different plattforms.

The easiest solution is the CC2531 USB Stick with the Znp (Zigbee Network Processor) Image, so that it works as an Zigbee gateway via serial port

### Digi XBee

Digi XBee is the brand name of a family of form factor compatible radio modules from Digi International.

We have tested it with the XBee ZigBee S2C chip

## Free beer !!

No. Sorry. But now that I have your attention .. we need your help! Since it is hardly possible to test all devices, let us know with which devices you have already successfully tested ZigBeeNet or where you encountered problems. Just open an Issue.

Many thanks!

## Hint

This project is highly inspired by https://github.com/zsmartsystems/com.zsmartsystems.zigbee and many ideas were adopted (almost a java -> c# port).

## Contributing

Feel free to open an issue if you have any idea or enhancement. If you want to implement on code create a fork and open a pull request.
